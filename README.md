# login-app
login-app is a simple user access application. It is built with react and uses graphql, an apollo server, and a pgsql database.

## Installation
To install, clone the git repository using the command: 
git clone https://github.com/descala1/login-app.git

```bash
From the project root folder run 
1. npm start
The app should automatically open. If not, navigate to http://localhost:3000
Using a separate bash window, run
2. node server.js
Enjoy!
```
## Usage
Register a user and login. Though the app runs locally a config file directs it to a remote pgsql db hosted with heroku.
